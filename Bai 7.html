        A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is
        believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the comer of the eyes,
        an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
